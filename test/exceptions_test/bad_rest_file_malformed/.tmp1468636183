[file.rest]
The file "file.rest" is a malformed YAML. Please fix it before executing it again:

while parsing a block mapping
  in "file.rest", line 2, column 3
expected <block end>, but found '<block mapping start>'
  in "file.rest", line 8, column 4
-------------------
Here is a simple sample of a valid rest file:
tests:
- id : mytest
  desc : "This is my test"
  path :  "/url-path"
  method : GET
  expect:
    http: 200
    data:
      ok : true
